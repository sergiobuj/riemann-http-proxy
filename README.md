# Riemann HTTP Proxy

The Riemann HTTP Proxy is a very small web server that accepts Riemann
events in edn format and forwards them to a Riemann server over
TCP.

The intended use-case is systems where it is impossible (or cumbersome)
to include a Riemann client library or implement one, but HTTP channels
are readily available. An example could be integrated systems with HTTP
capabilities, but with no available Riemann library.

## Usage

You can start the proxy either by cloning the project and running it
using lein run

    lein run --port 8080 --server my-riemann.com

or you can build a jar and run that if you need to put it in production

    lein uberjar
    java -jar target/riemann-http-proxy-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --port 1234 --server collector.host

Once the proxy is up and running, you can send events as edn data. The
events will be forwarded to the supplied Riemann host.

    curl -X POST -d"{:service \"my amazing service\" :state \"ok\", :metric 123 :host \"web1.app.com\"}" localhost:8080
